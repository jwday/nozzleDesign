# nozzleDesign
Simulates 1D gas flow through a converging-diverging (C-D) nozzle for CO2 and R134a, using a fixed-volume plenum chamber as the propellant source, with starting pressures at 100 and 87 psig, respectively.

Simulation can be performed either using isentropic relations or using interpolated/extrapolated NIST data. Simulation outputs .csv file with simulation results. Plots are generated in separate files.

Currently addressing organization/usability. Updates on the way.
